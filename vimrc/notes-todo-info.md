" vim: set nofoldenable: " Modeline to keep fold open by default in this file


# EASY TODO:
- make this a markdown file...
- add blank line above back in... need it all the time...
    ctrl o? (and map ctrl o to ctrl j?) ctrl enter? Shift enter?

# NOTES:
TODO:
- FIX TAGBAR ORDER. ITs ALMOST THERE...
- fix search to ignore folders properly... Just doesn't work well :{ ***

- highlight color yello? Or pink? Find something nice... Blue?
- are [h ]h in swapped? Isn't one NEXT and the other previous?
- fix di to work the same way dt does
- consider hiding statusline from time to time... JUST COLOR THE CURSOR FOR MODES. This could actually be amazing...
      - hard to do with neovim. Either turn on truecolor... which messes up the themes, or it doesn't work.
- Jump to JS comments (make ]m. ]c work)
   - / // OR /* [ up o ]down... YES
   - add 'motion' for jump to code section (after space or comment)
   https://github.com/okcompute/vim-javascript-motions/blob/master/autoload/javascript/motions.vim

## DO MVP now...
- make di" work... OR learn all the motions and remap to something better...?
- read up on ^ https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/2543/how-can-i-map-dcountd

- Configure magit properly
- Add total number of buffers next to the file name
- add colorization for saved, etc (dirty (bonus))
- move the statusline stuff off into a statusline file...
- at the very least, having git status, and mode in the top left is awesome. I don't use top right much... Maybe bottom right more.

- If I really really love this, try to get this working with a nvim custom build...
- fix nvim close behavior. Don't like being blocked when I know I want to leave
- figure out how to restore the O behavior proprely. Try going back on the o->; thing.

## Airline Tab color changes
- 1) adjust the color palette for edited, but not saved in the command line...
- 2) See if I can write my own that is this good...?
- 3) Add total buffer number?
- 4) Remove hunks? Pair down the mode lenght?

- Can we change tab color / tab symbol based on uncomiited
- Top tab color in normal:
   - 1 color for unsaved changes
   - 1 (color /) symbol for uncommitted changes (use gitgutter for that?) (then) (start small)
   - for unselected tabs, just fade the above symbols / colors. Let
   - write a post on how to do this?!? after I do it...
- top tab color in non-normal modes...

   Things to fix after this:
   - why does hunk info on bottom disappear?
   - why do all the same buffers keep opening?


## Common use cases:
Project wide find/replace: 1) Rg 2) select all results with tab and hit enter
to send to quickfix 3) Run cfdo to run command on every result found in
quickfix.
`cfdo %s/import stubLogger from "..\/..\/..\/utils\/stubLogger"/import { stubLogger } from "..\/..\/..\/utils\/logging"/g | update`

`:cn` opens next result in quickfix window

 List other implied files
## Short TODO LIST:
 - fix markdown folding text. Just use my own, and remove the plugin
 - Add this: https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat (allows you to repeat other motions with . (like searches))
 - fix t, insert modes in visual mode...
   fix t in normal mode too? swap with ctrl?
   fix the surround motions
   make MRU be local project only...

## BUFFER COLOR: Change buffer changed color (see email
## Edit:
 - <leader>e send dotfiles/vimrc to fzf

## SCROLLING:
 - Allow small scroll while keeping cursor in place (good for PS)
 Make key for "CLOSE" current window. instead of having to jump to the other.
 'q' should always do that... In all kinds of windows (help, location, etc)
 one...
## UNDO: Add keystroke / command for clearing undo history - add undo visualizer plugin...
   - add an undo stage limit... 100?!?


## FOLDS: Add custom folds to this file with  pattern?
 Change buffer modified color? (have buffer share mode color?)
 C-Z to undo in insert mode? (esc too?)
 C-U
 Replace nerdtree with find/tree + fzf?
 - Remove 1 line folds
 - Troubleshoot why some are missing
## FZF:
 - Combine all fzf modes with tab like ctrl p had. cycle modes like ctrl-p
 - Maybe denite? Or combine the 2? basically enter FIND mode
## Search:
   - on insert wipe highlidht
   https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/10407/stop-highlighting-when-entering-insert-mode
   - fix live search to include the index count. on incsearch.vim I don't want to have to use
   all these plugins to use orthogonal functionality
## Marks: - fix the fact that marks stay after close
   - change shift bs to be ` in all modes? Verify fixed in vim-signature

 TODO TextObjects: Make some more for JS, install comment one... etc.
 TODO Folding: remap [[ ]] to navigate the folds
   - add zebra striping / INCREASE CONTRAST
   - need to easily be able to jump to the next method / class / func
   - fix folds to auto fold 2 levels but load open
   - add folds to vimrc
 Map git keys to ctrl+ (like leeader p,r etc)
 Try to swatch swap O for : again (messes me up in insert mode. Use execute
 in command? (look at learnvimscript the hard way)
 Turn on alt for another layer of keys.
 CTAGS: Improve btags output... Closer to ctags...
 YANK RING?
 Think about going back to u, y, x, d as much as possible. Would love to get
 Maybe use ctrl for a lot of these... c-u c-y c-p
 back to natural language.
 Fix smooth scroll (don't go past the bottom of the line.
 " even normal ctrl scroll goes too far :{
 FIX: ZOOM WINDOW
 FIX: smarter swap warning (or at least force :e)? Use plugin that guy
 wrote? auto-swap?
 FIX t (till) in normal mode...
 FIX TAGBAR for classes. Why not nested? Remove node_modules.
 We can use that to show file outline if it shows up properly.
 Figure out how not to overwrite when buffer is open? Add warning?

 Find replacement for moving lines up and down... use it all the time. Cut
 from x line and paste somewhere else.
 Fix scroll highlight

 Q: p for paste again?

 Disable cpaps repeat?
 Remap <leader>f to <ctrl>-f and use that for a file buffer or ctrl T or
 something...

 - Turn on zoom window again?

 - fix inline anzu (fix *#/ as well)
 - turn on yankring / yankstack, or disable delete wiping yank history
 - have nvim use fish for terminal?

 - add key for btags MONEY, and / or add it to denite
 - fix tagbar exit with leader tab. Add toggle key? (turn it off for certain
   files to aviod being slow...)
 - integrate ripgrep with fzf. Maybe full / partial screen takeover... Goal
   is to easily see all the results of your search. Both in same file and
   across buffers / files.
   (LEADER-F maybe?)

 look at this: https://github.com/clvv/fasd
 - integrate unite / denite...
 - add window zoom back in...

 - think about more sensible general purpose shortcuts
   or commands for many things. leader-r doesn't make
   much sense. I need more senisble eaiser to remimber stuff

## QUICK KEYS:,###################
 ~/.vim/after/plugin/ - is where several things are placed that must be
 applied after this file

 Unassigned keys <leader> \ leader j
 Reassign git leader keys to ctrl?

## Philosophy:
 - use leader for frequent and very important stuff. Actions as it were.
   user straight keys when you're in the flow of someting and it's more in
   context.
 - Use ctrl+ for infrequent actions, and / or if it's an escalation.
   Letter -> shift+letter -> ctrl+letter
 - consider using double letters for firm / confirmation actions like qq to quit, CC to commit, etc

 Having contextual keys / strokes by buffer type / mode is awesome. Treat git staging as a MODE. Love it!

 Embrace modes! That's really the key I think. Think about how modes differ
 and how you can use context and modifier keys to work in your advantage. ie:
 Having numbers disabled / inverted in N mode makes complete sense if you never jump to
 line num.

 Try to stick with native vim stuff and learn that as much as possible. Avoid
 plugins that modify original behavior and remap strokes. Try instead to use
 plugins that enhance or make them more clear (like smooth scrolling etc).

 Try to use normal mappings and letters as much as possible. This will make
 it easier to switch to normal vim and back...

 - TODO: Use ctrl+ for more stuff. Consider moving some of the leader keys
   there. Either group classes of things (like nav), or move them by
   frequency used... After using them I can usually feel how nice or awkward
   they are...
